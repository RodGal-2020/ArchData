# 🏛️ ArchiData

ArchiData is an R package for the analysis of architectural data. It provides a suite of functions for analyzing and visualizing various aspects of architectural design, such as building dimensions, room layouts, and facade features.

> **Warning**: This is a new package I'm developing; don't expect it to work (for now at least).

## Installation

You can install ArchiData from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("RodGal-2020/ArchiData")
```

## Usage

To use ArchiData, simply load the package and start exploring your architectural data.

## License

See [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md).


## Ideas

- Ellipsis in all graphical functions with the `three_dots()` function.
- Emojis:
  - Use a certain style, as all of them in B&W or all from a certain palette or theme.
